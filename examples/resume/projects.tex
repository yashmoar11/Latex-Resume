  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item {Engineered a high-concurrency FastAPI backend with Server-Sent Events to stream AI responses token-by-token, decoupling inference from the request cycle and cutting time-to-first-response from ~5s to <100ms.}
      % \item {Engineered a self-correcting \textbf{LangGraph} pipeline with \textbf{Google Gemini}, autonomously grading document relevance and rewriting queries to meet accuracy thresholds.}
      \item {Built an interactive graph visualization in Next.js using react-force-graph-2d with useMemo caching, preventing re-renders during high-frequency stream updates and rendering live retrieval paths for users.}
      \item {Containerized the full polyglot stack (Python, Node.js, Neo4j) via Docker Compose with strict network rules, volume persistence, and end-to-end type safety (Pydantic + TypeScript), achieving 99.9\% deployment consistency.}
