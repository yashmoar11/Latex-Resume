\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I’m a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience at HSBC (India), and I will be joining Virginia Tech as a graduate student in Computer Engineering in Fall ’25. At HSBC, I focused on learning various aspects of building large-scale applications,
designing reusable frameworks, and implementing efficient architectures that ensure faster operations and now I'm excited to continue my journey and growing at Virginia Tech.
\lettersection{Why the Research Impact \& Intelligence Department?}
I am highly interested in the graduate assistantship opportunity in Research Intelligence, 
as it aligns closely with my analytical mindset and passion for data informed decision making in research strategy. 
With a strong foundation in software and data analysis, I am eager to contribute to activities such as research gap assessments, 
funding and collaboration analysis, and visualization of scientific output. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to support 
institutional goals through actionable intelligence and to gain hands-on experience with tools that drive innovation and strategic planning.
\lettersection{Why Me?}
Apart from good software hygiene practices, I have honed my skills in designing systems
optimized for deployment localization, redundancy, and scalability. My experience in data handling, visualization, and building user-centric 
applications enables me to effectively contribute to curating researcher profiles, generating strategic reports, and 
presenting research analytics for departmental and institutional needs. With a keen interest in digital identity management and research impact metrics, 
I am excited to assist in empowering researchers to navigate the evolving academic landscape.
% While working with systems at such a large scale, I realized the extraordinary computing resources required to fulfill our demands. Given the
% increasing complexity and scale of modern computing tasks, traditional system designs have become
% inadequate, requiring innovations in the software-hardware interface. This realization has sparked my
% interest in studying computer systems in detail and being at the forefront of these innovations. I am
% confident that my comprehensive experience and tenacious work ethic make me an excellent candidate for
% your Laboratory.
