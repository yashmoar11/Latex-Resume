\lettersection{Intent to Support}
I joined the Bradley Department as an M.S. student in Computer Engineering this fall with a focus on machine learning, 
and I’d like to be considered for a GTA role for the course \textbf{ECE XXXX - Course Title} (you as an instructor based on past data).
This semester I'm working with with Dr. Virgilio Centeno on \textbf{ECE 2054 (Applied Electrical Theory)} and \textbf{ECE 3304 (Intro to Power Systems)} 
totaling 102 students. I create assignment rubrics, 
maintain a quick grading turnaround, promptly respond to student queries regarding homework and grading,
tracking Canvas updates, and returning precise, encouraging feedback. A few habits I would carry into your class.
\lettersection{Professional and Project Experience}
Before grad school I worked three years at \textbf{HSBC Technology} delivering microservice platforms for global mortgage processing. 
building large-scale applications, \textbf{mentoring new engineers} through a revamped onboarding program, designing reusable frameworks, 
and implementing efficient architectures that ensure faster operations.
I have honed my ability to make decisions quickly and strengthened my skills in \textbf{documentation, reliability, and mentoring}.
Academically, projects such as an FPGA-based digital stopwatch, a remote patient monitoring porta, and Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
improved my \textbf{data-analysis} skills and sharpened my intuition for \textbf{designing systems}.
% Add professor-specific research interests or initiatives here.
\lettersection{Collaboration Opportunities}
I would gladly develop or polish rubrics and sample solutions, keep dependable office hours, handle forum questions and document the solutions 
for future reference, and contribute to any lab development 
you consider valuable. if you have time, I would appreciate meeting to explore how I can support and work with you this upcoming semester.
% While working with systems at such a large scale, I realized the extraordinary computing resources required to fulfill our demands. Given the
% increasing complexity and scale of modern computing tasks, traditional system designs have become
% inadequate, requiring innovations in the software-hardware interface. This realization has sparked my
% interest in studying computer systems in detail and being at the forefront of these innovations. I am
% confident that my comprehensive experience and tenacious work ethic make me an excellent candidate for
% your Laboratory.
