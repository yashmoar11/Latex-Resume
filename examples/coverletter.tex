\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Software Engineer with three years of industry experience at HSBC, pursuing my M.S. in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, where I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Having built scalable microservices and complex frontend architectures, I am eager to bring my technical depth and strong ownership to a Software Engineering Internship at your company. 

\lettersection{Taking Ownership \& Delivering Impact}
Throughout my career, I focus on delivering a high-quality work product. At HSBC, I noticed our teams duplicating effort when building localized UI elements. I took the initiative to architect a centralized frontend component using Higher Order Components in React. Adapting it to multiple regional requirements reduced redundant code by 20\% and cut implementation time by 30\%. This experience demonstrated my ability to identify inefficiencies, own the architecture, and deliver an impactful solution.

\lettersection{Dependability \& Engineering Discipline}
I firmly believe good engineering requires consistency and reliability, and I give 100\% to everything I do. This translates to a rigorous approach to system design and code quality. When improving our application infrastructure, I engineered CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Terraform, reducing deployment times by 40 minutes. I also took responsibility for code stability by resolving over 900 security vulnerabilities and increasing test coverage, ensuring zero critical issues in production. Teams can depend on me to deliver secure, well-tested software.

\lettersection{Why I Am a Strong Fit for this Internship}
As I continue to expand my technical foundation at Virginia Tech, my dedication and strong work ethic remain my greatest assets. Whether engineering a real-time knowledge graph system or managing instructional support as a Teaching Assistant, I am deeply serious about my work and committed to continuous improvement. I am excited to bring my industry experience, problem-solving mindset, and dedication to your engineering team.
